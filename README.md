jcamp-to-csv
============

JCAMP File Converter is a simple application that converts image metadata in JCAMP format to CSV format. This is a
two-step process:
1. Select a folder that contains JCAMP files
2. After a folder is selected, a CSV file can be then generated.

This project depends on Eric Bidelman's work on filer.js project. https://github.com/ebidel/filer.js

Thank you very much Eric Bidelman!

It also includes work from Kevin Jantzer <https://gist.github.com/kjantzer/7027717>
and Jim Palmer (https://github.com/overset/javascript-natural-sort) for their work in natural sort.

The library, filer.js which is utilized by the application only works in Chrome. Therefore, the application only works
in Chrome. Maybe at some point we should turn this application into a Chrome Extension.
